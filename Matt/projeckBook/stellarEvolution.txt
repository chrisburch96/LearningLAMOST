\section{Stellar Evolution}

The lifecycle of a star depends on its mass. More massive stars have shorter lifetimes, as shown in table \ref{massvlife}.

The first stage in the evolution of all stars is a dust cloud, called a nebula. Gravitational forces cause the cloud to collapse into a sphere, called a protostar.

The pressure in the protostar is enough that hydrogen fusion can take place in the core.

For lighter stars, such as the sun (\l)
