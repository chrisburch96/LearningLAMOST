A quick reference for git ...

################################
# First step - clone the repo to make a local copy ...

git clone https://github.com/grd349/LearningLAMOST.git

################################
# If you are going to do some work ...

git pull     # This brings you up to date

Now do some work e.g., create a git cheat sheet.

git status    # Tell you there is now an untracked file

git add .     # Adds all untracked files - use with caution... don't add everything

git status    # Tells you there is a new file

git commit -m "Added a git cheat sheet"   # Commits the changes

git push      # Pushes your local version into the repo.


################################
# This is all I have for now.

# If you get a conflict ... think pretty hard before doing anything.
#  It might be worth getting help for conflicts.
